# Ericsson_Intern_Task

## Overview: 
This is my solution to Ericsson recruitment tasks. 

## Using the code 
To build program you need:
* JDK 13 or later
* maven

In order to compile and run the code go to the exercise directory and type:
```
mvn clean package
```

then go to the "target" folder and type:
```
java - jar Exercise_no-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

where the "no" is number of exercise.

To run the tests just type:
```
mvn test
```
